<h3>Who/What is Mega Lucario</h3>

	<p>Mega Lucario is, as the name sounds, an evolution or stronger form of Lucario that was introduced in generation 6 with the introduction of <big>Mega Evolution</big> which is something that allows certain Pokemon to evolve a stage past their final evolution. The Black streaks all over its body show where its aura and the mega energy intermingled and raced through allowing it to produce stronger aura. But with this boosted stength and power comes some downsides with it. The huge boost in power is said to heighten its combat instincts so much so that it makes the Lucario governed almost by combat instincts solely, making its fighting style almost merciless and heartless</p>
